# Design Review: 06 — RBAC Administration (v2)

**Verdict: Revise and re-review.**

Both v1 blockers resolved: scopes fully documented with `--scope type=pattern`,
`--force` on `roles delete`, all error cases covered. However, **2 wire-format
bugs** remain that will cause runtime failures.

## Blockers

### B1 — `users roles set` body field is `assignments`, server expects `roles`

The design shows:

```json
{"assignments": [{"role": "builder", "scopes": [...]}]}
```

The server's `ReplaceUserRolesBody` has field `roles`:

```rust
struct ReplaceUserRolesBody {
    roles: Vec<RoleAssignmentBody>,
}
```

Sending `"assignments"` will deserialize as empty `roles`, silently removing all
user roles. This is a data-destructive wire-format bug.

**Fix:** Change `"assignments"` to `"roles"` in the request body example.

### B2 — Scope JSON field is `"type"`, not `"scope_type"`

The design shows:

```json
{ "scope_type": "channel", "pattern": "ces-devel" }
```

The server's `ScopeBody` has `#[serde(rename = "type")]` on the `scope_type`
field — the wire format is:

```json
{ "type": "channel", "pattern": "ces-devel" }
```

Sending `"scope_type"` will be ignored by serde (unknown field), producing scope
objects with no type — the server may accept them as empty or reject with a
validation error.

**Fix:** Change `"scope_type"` to `"type"` in all scope JSON examples.

## Major Concerns

### M1 — `admin users get` doesn't need two requests

The design says two requests are needed: (1) list all users, (2) get roles for
one user. But `GET /api/permissions/users` already returns
`Vec<UserWithRolesItem>` which includes `email`, `name`, `active`, AND `roles`
(with scopes). A single list request filtered client-side is sufficient.

**Fix:** Simplify to one request: `GET /api/permissions/users`, filter by email.
This eliminates the second request entirely.

## Minor Issues

- **`roles list` correctly drops caps column.** The server's `RoleListItem` has
  no caps — showing them only in `roles get` is the right call.

- **`admin:queue:view` capability documented.** Good.

- **Builtin role update → 409 documented.** Good.

- **Last-admin guard on `roles delete` and `roles update` documented.** Good.

- **Role assignment not found → 404 documented.** Good.

- **Scope-dependent role without scopes → 400 documented.** Good.

## Strengths

- Scope model is now fully documented with `--scope` flag, scope types, and the
  scope-dependent capability enforcement.
- `--force` on `roles delete` correctly maps to `?force=true`.
- Error handling section is comprehensive (9 cases).
- `roles update` notes `name` must match path parameter.
- `users list` notes scopes omitted with pointer to `users get`.
- `users get` shows full role + scope detail view.
